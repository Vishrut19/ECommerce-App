This project is a basic ECommerce Website Model using React,Typescript,GraphQL, which consists of many functionalities such as :
- It has category page for different category products like Tech,Clothes etc.
- It has a dropdown for different currency and the value changes according to different currency selection.
- A product view page.
- A cart view, checkout and a mini cart view page too.

During the development process, I used:
 - React+Typescript
 - Redux-Toolkit
 - GraphQL (@tilework/opus)

 As it was a organisation's task so the GraphQL end-point was provided by them.
 
 The project was completed in accordance with the requirements:
 
 ## Required:

- React. 
- Class components.
- Create-react-app to scaffold the application.

## Allowed:

- State management libraries (e.g. Redux, Recoil)
- CSS-in-JS approach allowers (e.g. styled-components)

## Prohibited:

- Functional components, due to the reasons described above.
